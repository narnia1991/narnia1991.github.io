# It's 2025

I've been a developer for 8 years now, but I still don't have a solid portfolio to show whenever I'm applying to job postings. I want to at least do this for myself and not just for show. One thing that I think God is pushing me to do is to journal. For years, it's been on every subject I'm studying. Whether in church, in work, in trading or even in self help books, there's always a topic explaining the importance of journaling. Thus, I start this project.

## The problem

There's a lot I want to do, but I always start and not follow through most of the times; ending, I don't have a solid collection that I could show. There's also a lot of topics I want to explore, a lot I want to share but I can't seem to find the time. One problem also is, since I know how to do most of the things or at least I think I do, I don't leverage the help of others; whether another person, a built solution, or even the help of AI.

## The Goal

I've been trying to create a portfolio, but for now, I want to create a simple journal app first, Then a directory for my previous studies.

## The plan

Do small steps everyday. Time box to max of 2 hours a day to avoid burnout.
Create a plan weekly so I don't get stuck thinking what I should do next.
